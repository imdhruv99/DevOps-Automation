h2. Cloud Provider: Amazon Web services
----

- AWS is cloud computing platform provides IAAS, PAAS, SAAS.
- AWS provides Services such as Compute, Container, Storage, Database, Security, Machine Learning, Managemnet, Game Developmnet, Satelite, BlockChain, Quantum Computing etc...

Below listed services is used by me.

*Amazon EC2*
- It is a web service interface that provides resizable compute capacity in the AWS cloud. 
- It is designed for developers to have complete control over web-scaling and computing resources.
- We can limit number of access using SG group.

*Auto Scaling*
- Auto Scaling is particularly effective for those applications that fluctuate on hourly, daily, or weekly usage. 
- Auto Scaling is enabled by Amazon CloudWatch and is available at no extra cost.

*AWS CloudWatch*
AWS CloudWatch can be used to measure CPU utilization, network traffic, etc.

*Elastic Load Balancing*
- Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) automatically distributes incoming request traffic across multiple Amazon EC2 instances and results in achieving higher fault tolerance.
- It detects unfit instances and automatically reroutes traffic to fit instances until the unfit instances have been restored in a round-robin manner.

*AWS Lambda*
- AWS Lambda is a responsive cloud service that inspects actions within the application and responds by deploying the user-defined codes, known as functions. 
- Lambda manages the compute fleet that offers a balance of memory, CPU, network, and other resources to run your code.
- Lambda performs operational and administrative activities on your behalf, including managing capacity, monitoring, and logging your Lambda functions.

*AWS VPC*
- Amazon VPC is the networking layer for Amazon EC2.
- Basic key concept of VPC, subnet, Route Table, Internet Gateway, VPC Endpoint, CIDR Block.

*AWS Route 53*
- Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System web service. 
- We can use Route 53 to perform three main functions in any combination: domain registration, DNS routing, and health checking.

*AWS S3*
- Amazon Simple Storage Service is storage for the Internet. AWS S3 uses bucket to store the data and data is stored as Objects in bucket.
- A bucket is a container for objects stored in Amazon S3. A key is the unique identifier for an object within a bucket and Every object in a bucket has exactly one key.
- AWS S# supports API access for Developers.

*AWS S3 Glacier*
- It is low-cost and used for data archiving and long-term backup.
- An archive is any object, such as a photo, video, or document, that you store in a vault. It is a base unit of storage in Amazon S3 Glacier

*AWS ECS*
- Amazon Elastic Container Service is a highly scalable, fast container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage containers on a cluster.
- We can define container using task definition. Containers are typically build using docker or any other container services.
- AWS Farget is serverless infrastructure to run container on server.

*AWS ECR*
- Amazon Elastic Container Registry is an AWS managed container image registry service that is secure, scalable, and reliable.
- Amazon ECR supports private container image repositories with resource-based permissions using AWS IAM.

*AWS IAM*
- AWS Identity and Access Management is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources.
- We can create permission and it's policies, users and user groups using IAM.
- IAM also has API access for Developers.

*Amazon Comprehend*
- Amazon Comprehend uses natural language processing to extract insights about the content of documents. Amazon Comprehend processes any text file in UTF-8 format.
- Amazon Comprehend also supports API access.

*Amazon Textract*
- Amazon Textract makes it easy to add document text detection and analysis to your applications. 
- The Amazon Textract Text Detection API can detect typed and handwritten text in a variety of documents including financial reports, medical records, and tax forms. 
- For documents with structured data, you can use the Amazon Textract Document Analysis API to extract text, forms, and tables.

*Amazon Athena*
- It is analytic service. using this we can execute SQL queries directly on AWS S3.

*AWS CloudFormation*
- It is infrastructure as a code service specifically for AWS. It supports JSON and YAML both. We can create whole infra structure using CloudFormation.
