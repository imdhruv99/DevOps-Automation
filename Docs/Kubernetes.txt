h2. Container Orchestration: Kubernetes
----
h3. *What is Kubernetes?*
 - K8s is Open Source Container Orchestration Tool, originally developed by Google
 - It helps us to manage containerized applications in different environments

h3. *Features of K8s*
 - High Availability or No Downtime [Always accessible by users]
 - Scalability or High Performance [Users have very high response rate from the application]
 - Disaster Recovery - Backup and Restore [If something bad happens with server K8s has tech to take bakup of data where it stopped working and resume again from that point]

h3. *Components of K8s*
 - *Node:* Node is a simple server or virtual machine

 - *Pod:* It's smallest unit of K8s and abstraction over the container. It creates running env for container. Using pod we do not have to directly work with container technology. we only interact with the K8s layer.
 We can run multiple container inside the one pod but usually we only run 1 container per pod with side service. Each pod gets it's own ip address and each pod can communicate with each other using IP address.
 IP addresses are internal Ips not the public IPs. Pods can die very easily and if one pod dies than new one will be replaced by that pod with new IP address.

 - *Service and Ingress:* Provides permanent IP address that can ne attached with pod. Life cycle of pods and service are not connected so if pod dies the service and it's ip will stay.
 External service open communication from external sources. Internal Service can not be accessed by external sources such as database can't accessed by users. We use Ingress for external service.
 Service is load balancer which will get the request and send it to the pod which is less busy.

 - *ConfigMap:* It is external configuration of application. It usually contains the urls of database or some other services. It connected to the pods so pods get data from that url.
 So now we changes any thing in database or any other service we do no have to build image again and push it to pod.

 - *Secret:* It is just like configMap but it is used to store secret data such as credentials, certificates etc in base 64 encoded format. The built in security mechanism is not enabled by default.

 - *Volumes:* It attaches physical storage to pod. Storage could be on server node or remote storage. So if pod restarted your data will not lost.

 - *Deployment and Stateful set:* We replicate everything including node itself. The replica is connected to the same service with permanent IP address.
 We will not create second pod for replication, we will define blueprints of the pods. Blueprints is called as Deployment. Deployment can be scaled up and down. 
 Deployment is another abstraction over the pods.
 Database can not replicated by deployment because database has the state which is it's data. If we replicate it will create inconsistencies of data. 
 StatefulSet is use to communicate with database through the pod. StatefulSet will take care of replication in the manner that it will not create inconsistencies.

h3. *K8s Architecture*
 - Kubernetes cluster consists of at least one master and multiple compute nodes
 - The master is responsible for exposing the application program interface (API), scheduling the deployments and managing the overall cluster.
 - Each node runs a container runtime, such as Docker, along with an agent that communicates with the master.
 - The node also runs additional components for logging, monitoring, service discovery and optional add-ons. Nodes are the workhorses of a Kubernetes cluster.
 - They expose compute, networking and storage resources to applications.
 - The definition of Kubernetes objects, such as pods, replica sets and services, are submitted to the master. Based on the defined requirements and availability of resources, the master schedules the pod on a specific node.
 - The node pulls the images from the container image registry and coordinates with the local container runtime to launch the container.

h3. *Minikube & Kubectl*
 - *Minikube:* A ONE Node cluster, where the master and worker processes are on the same machine.
 - *Kubectl:* The command line tool for Kubernetes, then enables the interaction with the cluster: to create pods, services and other components

h3. *Setup Minikube and Running Demo Project*

*Install command*
{code:java}
brew install minikube
{code}
